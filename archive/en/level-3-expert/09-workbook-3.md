## 9. Workbook 3: Automating Meeting Minutes and Visualization Reports

This is the final hurdle. Let's turn a rough meeting memo into a handsome report.

### [Step 1] Prepare the Meeting Memo
Prepare a roughly written meeting memo (`meeting_note.txt`).

### [Step 2] Request Report Creation
> **Input:**
> "@workspace Based on `meeting_note.txt`, please create a 'Weekly Business Report'.
> 1. Organize the main agenda items into a table.
> 2. Draw the future schedule as a Mermaid Gantt chart.
> 3. Make the overall tone dry, 'for reporting purposes'."

### [Step 3] Check the Result
Did a perfect report with tables and charts come out?
You are now an **'AI Administration Master'**.
