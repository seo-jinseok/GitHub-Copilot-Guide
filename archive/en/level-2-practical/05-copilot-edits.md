## 5. Copilot Edits: Modifying Multiple Files at Once

**[2025 New Feature]**
Until now, you've been copying and pasting from the chat window, right? Now, you can command Copilot to edit the files directly. This is **Copilot Edits**.

### 5.1 How to Use
1.  Change the mode at the bottom of the chat window (`Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I`) to **'Edits'**.
2.  Drag the files you want to edit into the chat window, or select them by pressing the `#` key.
3.  Give the command.
    > "Change the year from 2024 to 2025 in all 5 of these files. Also, add a 'Confidential' mark at the top of the documents."
4.  Copilot will show you a plan of the edits. Press **'Accept'** to apply the changes to the files.

### 5.2 When to Use
*   When standardizing the format of multiple files.
*   When regulations change and you need to modify a specific phrase in all documents.
*   When you want to finish simple repetitive tasks in one go.
