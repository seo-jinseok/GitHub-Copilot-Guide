## 4. Prompt Engineering: Making the AI Understand You Perfectly Even When You Speak Casually

Being able to command an AI effectively is a skill. This is called 'Prompt Engineering'. It's not difficult. Just remember three things: **Role, Context, Output**.

### 4.1 The R.C.O. Formula
*   **Role:** "You are a veteran administrator with 10 years of experience."
*   **Context:** "I am currently preparing materials for an audit by the Ministry of Education."
*   **Output:** "Organize a list of anticipated audit findings into a table."

### 4.2 Adjusting Tone and Manner
You can control the AI's tone of voice.
*   "Write in a dry, objective tone." (For reports)
*   "Write in a friendly and gentle tone." (For announcements)
*   "Summarize only the key points in bullet-point style." (For executive reports)
