## 6. Workbook 2: Remodeling Last Year's Report into This Year's Version

You have an excellent business plan written by a senior colleague last year. Let's create this year's version based on it.

### [Step 1] Gather Your Materials
1.  Open last year's business plan file (`plan_2024.md`). (If you don't have one, just create one with some content.)
2.  Create a memo (`memo_2025.txt`) containing this year's key initiatives.

### [Step 2] Summon Copilot Edits
1.  Change the chat window to **Edits mode**.
2.  Reference both files using `@`.

### [Step 3] Give the Command
> **Input:**
> "Create a new `plan_2025.md` based on last year's plan (`plan_2024.md`).
> However, you must modify the 'Propulsion Strategy' section to reflect this year's key initiatives from `memo_2025.txt`.
> Update all dates to 2025, and calculate the budget with a 5% increase from last year."

### [Step 4] Review and Approve
Copilot will show you the modified content.
*   Red: Deleted content
*   Green: Added content
If the content is correct, press **'Accept'** to save.

> [!TIP]
> **Success Check:** Did the 1-hour 'copy-paste' and 'modify' job finish in 5 minutes? Congratulations. You have now mastered the 'Practical Level'.
