## 3. Workbook 1: Finish an English Email in 3 Minutes

Now, let's not just watch, let's do it ourselves. We'll write an email to a foreign university requesting a partnership renewal.

### [Step 1] Create a file
1.  In VS Code, press `File > New File`.
2.  Save it as `email_draft.md`. (The `.md` extension is important!)

### [Step 2] Explain the situation (Chat)
In the right-hand chat window (`Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I`), type the following:

> **Input:**
> "I am a staff member of the International Exchange Team at OO University. I need to send an email to our American partner, ABC University, to request a renewal of our student exchange agreement. Please draft it in polite and formal business English."

### [Step 3] Check and Modify the Result
Copy the English text written by Copilot and paste it into the editor. Then, try modifying the content a little.

### [Step 4] Experience Autocomplete
At the end of the email, type `Sincerely,` and press Enter.
Copilot will suggest your name or title in gray text. Press `Tab` to complete it.

> [!NOTE]
> **Success Check:** Was the email draft completed in under 3 minutes? If so, you've passed Level 1!
