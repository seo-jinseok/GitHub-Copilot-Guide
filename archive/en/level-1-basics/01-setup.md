# [Level 1: Getting Started] First Steps of an AI Administrator

## 1. Preparation: Creating Your Own Digital Office

To work with AI, you need to build them a home. We will build a house called **VS Code** and hire a butler named **GitHub Copilot**.

### 1.1 Installation and Setup (Latest for 2025)
1.  **Install Visual Studio Code:** Download and install from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).
2.  **GitHub Copilot Extension:**
    *   Click the 'Blocks icon (Extensions)' on the left in VS Code → Search for `GitHub Copilot` and install.
    *   **Important:** Starting from the 2025 version, `Copilot Chat` is integrated and does not require a separate installation.
3.  **Login:** Log in with your GitHub account via the notification at the bottom right or the profile icon on the left.

### 1.2 Understanding the Screen Layout
*   **Editor:** The main screen where you write text (like in Word/Hangul).
*   **Sidebar:** The left area where the file list is visible.
*   **Secondary Sidebar:** The right area where the Copilot chat window opens (toggle with `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I`).
