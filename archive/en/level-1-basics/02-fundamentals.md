## 2. Basics: Differentiating Chat and Autocomplete

There are two main ways to use Copilot. Just by distinguishing these two, you are in the top 10%.

### 2.1 Interactive (Chat): "Do this for me"
This is like talking to an assistant in the right-hand chat window.
*   **When to use?** When asking something you don't know, summarizing a long text, or asking for something to be created from scratch.
*   **Shortcut:** `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I` (Sidebar Chat)

### 2.2 Autocomplete (Ghost Text): "Read my mind"
As you type in the editor, it shows you the next part of the text in gray.
*   **When to use?** While writing a document, when the next sentence is obvious, or when filling in a table.
*   **How to use:** If you like the gray text, press the `Tab` key to accept it.

> [!TIP]
> **Administrator's Tip:** **Autocomplete** is convenient for drafting a report's table of contents, while **Chat** is convenient for filling in the report's content.
