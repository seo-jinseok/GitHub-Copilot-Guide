# Product Requirements Document: University Copilot Guide Finalization

## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this phase is to consolidate all previous work—including legacy files, staging content, and the current documentation structure—into a **single, comprehensive, easy-to-read file** (one for English, one for Korean) specifically designed for university administrative staff who may not be familiar with computers or complex file structures.

## 2. Objectives
- **Audience-Centric Design:** Tailor the final output for non-technical administrative staff, ensuring clarity and accessibility.
- **Consolidation:** Merge content from `legacy/`, `staging/`, `docs/`, and root-level Markdown files.
- **Single-File Output:** Generate one comprehensive Markdown file per language in a `dist/` folder:
  - `dist/University_Copilot_Guide_Complete_EN.md`
  - `dist/University_Copilot_Guide_Complete_KO.md`
- **Visual Enrichment:** Add Mermaid diagrams and SVG visualizations throughout to enhance understanding.
- **Standardization:** Ensure consistent formatting, friendly tone, and clear navigation within the single file.
- **Cleanup:** Remove `docs/`, `legacy/`, `staging/`, and root-level content files after migration is verified.

## 3. Scope of Work

### 3.1. Content Analysis & Integration

#### Source File Inventory (Priority Order)
- **Source 1 (HIGHEST PRIORITY): Current Documentation (`docs/en/` and `docs/ko/`)**
  - Extract all content from level-1, level-2, level-3, and appendix folders.
  - Integrate workbook exercises inline within relevant sections.
  - This is the primary source - defer to this content in case of conflicts.
- **Source 2 (HIGH PRIORITY): Staging (`staging/refined_content.md`)**
  - Integrate refined content improvements into the main narrative.
  - Use to enhance Source 1 content where improvements exist.
- **Source 3 (MEDIUM PRIORITY): Legacy (`legacy/`)**
  - Extract relevant "Admin" specific workflows and merge into a dedicated "Administrative Workflows" section.
  - Only use content NOT already covered in Sources 1-2.
- **Source 4 (MEDIUM PRIORITY): Root Files**
  - Incorporate content from `University_Copilot_Guide_for_Beginners.md` and `University_Copilot_Guide_Admin.md`.
  - Fill gaps not covered by Sources 1-3.
- **Source 5 (SUPPLEMENTARY): Templates (`templates/exercises/`)**
  - Integrate exercise templates as inline examples within the single file.
  
#### Content Priority Hierarchy (Conflict Resolution)
When duplicate or conflicting content exists:
1. Use `docs/` version (most structured)
2. Enhance with `staging/` improvements
3. Add unique sections from `legacy/` Admin guides
4. Fill remaining gaps with root-level files
5. Supplement with template exercises

#### Pre-Migration Verification
- Verify all source files exist before beginning migration
- Create content map/inventory showing which sections come from which sources
- Identify duplicate content and mark primary source

### 3.3. Visual Enhancement Strategy

#### Diagram Requirements by Section (Minimum 10-15 total)
Each visual should be created using Mermaid (for flowcharts/diagrams) or SVG (for custom graphics).

**Level 1: Basics (3-4 visuals)**
1. **Setup Flow**: Mermaid flowchart showing installation → authentication → first use
2. **Copilot Architecture**: SVG diagram showing user ↔ Copilot ↔ AI model relationship
3. **Interface Overview**: Annotated screenshot/diagram of Copilot UI components
4. **First Prompt Example**: Visual workflow of typing prompt → receiving response

**Level 2: Practical Applications (3-4 visuals)**
5. **Prompt Engineering Cycle**: Flowchart showing iterative refinement process
6. **Good vs. Bad Prompts**: Side-by-side comparison diagram
7. **Copilot Edits Workflow**: Step-by-step visual of using edit mode
8. **Document Generation Process**: Mermaid sequence diagram

**Level 3: Advanced Usage (3-4 visuals)**
9. **Agent Instruction Flow**: How custom instructions modify Copilot behavior
10. **Data Visualization Pipeline**: Input data → Copilot → Chart/Graph output
11. **Workspace Context**: Diagram showing how Copilot uses project files
12. **Multi-file Editing**: Visual showing simultaneous file operations

**Administrative Guide (2-3 visuals)**
13. **Admin Task Workflow**: Common university admin tasks with Copilot
14. **Email/Report Templates**: Visual examples of before/after
15. **Meeting Notes Processing**: Flowchart for converting notes to action items

**Technical Requirements**:
- All Mermaid diagrams embedded directly in Markdown (```mermaid blocks)
- SVG files stored in `dist/images/` with Korean-language versions in `dist/images/ko/`
- Use simple, clear visual language appropriate for non-technical users
- Include alt-text for accessibility
- Test rendering in common Markdown viewers (VS Code, GitHub, Obsidian)

### 3.4. Implementation Tasks
1. **Pre-Migration Backup:** Create archive of current state before any deletions
2. **Content Audit:** Review all source files and create content map
3. **Content Refinement:** Rewrite technical jargon to be accessible to administrative staff
4. **Visual Creation:** Design and integrate Mermaid/SVG diagrams
5. **Merge & Compile:** Concatenate all content into single-file format with smooth transitions
6. **TOC Generation:** Create auto-linked table of contents
7. **Asset Management:** Organize images in `dist/images/` with correct relative paths
8. **Localization QA:** Verify EN/KO content parity
9. **Review & Polish:** Verify document flow and accessibility
10. **Verification:** Confirm all content migrated successfully
11. **Cleanup:** Remove `docs/`, `legacy/`, `staging/`, and redundant root files only after verification

## 4. Success Metrics
- Two single, cohesive Markdown files exist in `dist/` folder
- Each file contains 10-15+ Mermaid/SVG visualizations
- Content is understandable by non-technical staff
- No duplicate content; all legacy value is captured
- Automatic table of contents with working internal links
- File is easily convertible to PDF with proper image rendering
- Project root is clean, containing only configuration files

## 5. Constraints
- The final file must be standard Markdown with Mermaid support
- Maintain exact bilingual parity (EN and KO versions must mirror each other)
- All images must use relative paths within `dist/` folder
- File size should remain reasonable for email/sharing (< 5MB per file)
- **DATA LOSS PREVENTION:** Archive existing `docs/`, `legacy/`, `staging/` folders to `archive/` before deletion
- No deletion of source files until final output is verified and approved
- All source files must be verified to exist before starting migration

## 6. Deliverables
1. `dist/University_Copilot_Guide_Complete_EN.md` (Complete English guide)
2. `dist/University_Copilot_Guide_Complete_KO.md` (Complete Korean guide)
3. `dist/images/` (Folder containing all visual assets)
4. `dist/images/ko/` (Korean-specific visual assets with translated labels)
5. `archive/` (Backup of migrated source folders before deletion)
6. Clean project structure with obsolete files removed

## 7. Localization Strategy

### Bilingual Content Approach
- **Content Parity**: Both EN and KO versions must contain identical information
- **Visual Localization**: Diagrams with text labels must have Korean versions
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Examples and scenarios should be appropriate for Korean university context
- **File Naming**: Clear EN/KO suffixes for all assets

### Translation Quality Assurance
- Use existing Korean translations from `docs/ko/` as baseline
- Verify terminology consistency across all Korean content
- Ensure technical terms are properly localized or explained
- Review tone and formality appropriate for Korean academic staff

### Maintenance Strategy
- Document which sections require manual translation updates
- Create checklist for keeping EN/KO versions synchronized
- Note any EN-only or KO-only content (if necessary) with clear justification
