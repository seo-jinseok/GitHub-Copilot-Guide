			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Environment Setup and Pre-Migration Backup",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward filesystem operation involving directory creation and file copying. It requires basic shell commands or a simple script. The complexity is low as it does not involve logic changes or content parsing, just safe duplication of existing assets."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Content Inventory and Source Mapping",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a detailed mapping strategy. Subtasks: 1. Inventory existing `docs/` structure and map to PRD sections. 2. Analyze `staging/` and `legacy/` for unique content requiring integration. 3. Generate the final `content_map.json`.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires deep analysis of multiple source directories (`docs`, `staging`, `legacy`) which may have overlapping or conflicting content. Creating a precise JSON map is critical for the subsequent automation steps, making this a moderately complex analytical task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "English Content Consolidation (Drafting)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the consolidation process. Subtasks: 1. Develop a script to concatenate files based on `content_map.json`. 2. Implement logic to resolve content conflicts (staging vs docs). 3. Normalise markdown headers programmatically. 4. Manually review and refine the stitched document.",
			"reasoning": "Merging content from heterogeneous sources while normalizing headers and resolving conflicts is technically challenging. It requires robust script logic to handle inconsistent formatting across legacy and new files, pushing the complexity higher."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Korean Content Consolidation (Drafting)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Plan the localization consolidation. Subtasks: 1. Replicate the English consolidation logic for Korean sources. 2. Identify and flag missing translations (gap analysis). 3. Integrate existing root-level KO files. 4. Perform terminology consistency check.",
			"reasoning": "This inherits the complexity of the English consolidation but adds the difficulty of handling missing translations ('gap analysis'). Ensuring parity when source structures might differ (e.g., missing `staging` files for KO) adds significant logical complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Visual Enhancement: Basics and Practical Levels",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the diagram creation. Subtasks: 1. Design and code Mermaid diagrams for English sections. 2. Duplicate and translate diagram labels for Korean sections.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is moderate. While Mermaid syntax is standard, ensuring the diagrams accurately reflect the text content requires cognitive effort. The technical implementation is simple, but the design aspect raises the score slightly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Visual Enhancement: Advanced and Admin Levels",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the advanced diagram creation. Subtasks: 1. Design Mermaid workflows for complex Admin/Advanced processes. 2. Localize diagrams for the Korean version.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to Task 15, but potentially more complex domain logic to visualize (e.g., API flows or Admin workflows). The technical task remains creating and embedding code blocks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Administrative Guide Section Refinement",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the refinement process. Subtasks: 1. Audit current Admin content for technical jargon. 2. Draft 'Good vs Bad' prompt examples for admin scenarios. 3. Rewrite workflow instructions for clarity.",
			"reasoning": "This is a content-heavy task requiring domain understanding and writing skills rather than coding complex logic. Refactoring technical content for a non-technical audience is time-consuming and requires careful editorial judgment."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Formatting, Navigation, and TOC Generation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Standard markdown maintenance. Most modern editors or pre-processors handle TOC generation automatically. Fixing relative links and anchors is tedious but low-complexity work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Localization QA and Parity Verification",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the QA process. Subtasks: 1. Conduct a section-by-section structural audit (EN vs KO). 2. Verify asset localization (images/diagrams).",
			"reasoning": "QA is critical and requires attention to detail. The complexity comes from the manual effort required to cross-reference two large documents and ensuring that 'parity' doesn't just mean identical structure, but also accurate context."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Project Cleanup and Final Delivery",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "A final cleanup task. Low complexity as it involves deleting files and verifying directory structures. The risk is high (data loss), but the technical difficulty is low provided backups exist."
