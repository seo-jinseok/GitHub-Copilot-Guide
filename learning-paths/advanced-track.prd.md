## Capability: Advanced AI-Driven Workflow Automation

**Description:** This capability empowers administrators to automate complex, multi-step tasks by leveraging advanced Copilot features like prompt engineering, multi-file edits, and data analysis, moving from simple assistance to proactive workflow automation.

### Feature 1: Prompt Engineering Mastery
- **Description:** Teaches the R.C.O. (Role, Context, Output) framework for crafting precise and effective prompts.
- **User Story:** As an administrator, I want to master prompt engineering so that I can get high-quality, predictable results from the AI with minimal re-phrasing.

### Feature 2: Multi-File Editing with Copilot Edits
- **Description:** Introduces the "Edits" mode to perform simultaneous modifications across multiple documents, such as updating report dates or standardizing formats.
- **User Story:** As an administrator, I want to use Copilot Edits to automate repetitive changes across many files so that I can save time and reduce manual errors.

### Feature 3: AI-Assisted Data Analysis & Visualization
- **Description:** Covers the use of AI for data analysis from files (e.g., .xlsx) and the creation of diagrams using text-based tools like Mermaid.
- **User Story:** As an administrator, I want to analyze data and create visualizations without leaving my editor so that I can quickly generate insights and reports.

### Feature 4: Customizing Copilot with Agents & Instructions
- **Description:** Explains how to create persistent rules for Copilot's behavior (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) and how to invoke specialized agents (`@workspace`) for context-aware tasks.
- **User Story:** As an administrator, I want to customize Copilot for my department's specific needs so that it acts as a specialized assistant.
