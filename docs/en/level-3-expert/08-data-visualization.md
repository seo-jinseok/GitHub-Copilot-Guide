## 8. Data & Visualization: Analyzing and Drawing Without Excel

### 8.1 Drawing Charts with Text (Mermaid)
Don't waste time drawing shapes in PowerPoint. Just write text, and it becomes a picture.

**[Practice] Drawing a Workflow Diagram**
Copy and paste the code below.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Draft Proposal] --> B{Team Lead Approval?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Final Decision by Head];
    B -- No --> D[Rejected];
```
