University members receive the same benefits as **GitHub Copilot Pro** for free. Here, a **'Credit'** system is applied, allowing much more freedom of use.

#### 1️⃣ Standard Models - **Completely Unlimited! (0x)**
These models consume no credits at all. **Even if you use them thousands of times a day, they're free**.

### 🧐 What Do "0x" and "1x" Mean?

This is the most confusing part! The meaning **completely changes depending on "your status (free vs university)"**.

| Category | When Using **0x (Standard)** Models | When Using **1x (Premium)** Models |
|----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Free Users** | **1 request deducted** from my limit (50) 😭 | **1 request deducted** from my limit (50) 😭 |
| **University Members** | **No deduction (completely free/unlimited)** 🎉 | **1 credit deducted** (within 300/month limit) |

> **🎁 Conclusion:** If you're a university member, **"0x models are free, 1x models use 300 monthly tickets"** is the most accurate understanding!

- Korean question → Korean answer ✅
- Korean question → Request English answer ✅
- English question → Request Korean answer ✅

**Example:**
```
"Summarize the following English paper in Korean"
[Paste English paper]
```

### Q2: What happens if I use up my monthly allowance?

**A:** Don't worry!

**Free Users (50 requests used):**
- 50 requests will be recharged next month.
- Or if you verify university status, it immediately becomes unlimited!

**University Members:**
- **The 5 basic models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-5 mini, Grok, Raptor) are completely unlimited**, so no worries!
- Premium models (Claude, Gemini, etc.) also provide sufficient monthly amounts.

---

### Q3: What's different between models? Which should I use?

**A:** Simply summarized:

| Situation | Recommended Model | One-line Reason | Usage Limit |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| General tasks | **GPT-4o** | Most reliable and fast | **Unlimited** |
| High-performance reasoning | **GPT-4.1** | Complex logical tasks | **Unlimited** |
| Fast code writing | **Grok Code Fast 1** | Very fast code generation | **Unlimited** |
| When you want nice writing | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Excellent writing skills | Premium |
| Analyzing long documents | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Processes large amounts at once | Premium |

**If you're a beginner:** Start with **GPT-4o**! It's unlimited and most reliable and fast.

---

### Q4: Do follow-up questions consume additional counts?

**A:** Yes, **follow-up questions also count as 1 request**.

```
First question: "Draft a report" (1 request consumed)
↓
Follow-up: "Make it shorter" (1 additional request consumed)
↓
Follow-up: "Also make an English version" (1 additional request consumed)
```
**Total 3 requests consumed!**

**💡 Saving Tip:**
```
"Draft a report, summarize it within 200 characters, 
and also create an English version"
```
**This way only 1 request consumed!**

---

### Q5: Is the web version alone sufficient without VS Code?

**A:** It depends on the purpose!

**Web version is sufficient for:**
- Email, report writing
- Document summary, translation
- Idea brainstorming
- Simple code questions

**VS Code is needed for:**
- When you need auto-completion while actually coding
- When proceeding with programming projects

**If you're a non-major:** The web version alone is sufficient! If you don't code at all, you don't need to install VS Code.

---

### Q6: Is it safe to ask questions with personal or sensitive information?

**A:** **University members are safe!**

| Category | Data Usage Policy |
|----------|-------------------|
| Free Users | ⚠️ May be used for AI training |
| University Members (Education) | ✅ **Never used for training** guaranteed |

**But be careful:**
- Never input student personal information (resident registration numbers, phone numbers, etc.)
- Generalize sensitive school internal information when asking

**Safe Question Examples:**
```
❌ "How should I handle student Hong Gil-dong's (010-1234-5678) grades?"
✅ "What's the general procedure when receiving a grade correction request?"
```
