Especially for **university students and professors**, it's provided **completely free**, and you can use the latest AI models from **OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google** all in one place.

This guide, written as of **November 2025**, will show you everything about using GitHub Copilot on the web without any installation.

"Draft a report, summarize it within 200 characters, 
and also create an English version"
```
**This way only 1 request consumed!**

---

### Q5: Is the web version alone sufficient without VS Code?

**A:** It depends on the purpose!

**Web version is sufficient for:**
- Email, report writing
- Document summary, translation
- Idea brainstorming
- Simple code questions

**VS Code is needed for:**
- When you need auto-completion while actually coding
- When proceeding with programming projects

**If you're a non-major:** The web version alone is sufficient! If you don't code at all, you don't need to install VS Code.

---

### Q6: Is it safe to ask questions with personal or sensitive information?

**A:** **University members are safe!**

| Category | Data Usage Policy |
|----------|-------------------|
| Free Users | ⚠️ May be used for AI training |
| University Members (Education) | ✅ **Never used for training** guaranteed |

**But be careful:**
- Never input student personal information (resident registration numbers, phone numbers, etc.)
- Generalize sensitive school internal information when asking

**Safe Question Examples:**
```
❌ "How should I handle student Hong Gil-dong's (010-1234-5678) grades?"
✅ "What's the general procedure when receiving a grade correction request?"
```
