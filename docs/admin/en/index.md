## Why VS Code + Copilot Instead of ChatGPT?

### I'm Already Using ChatGPT/Claude – Why Learn Another Tool?

"I'm already using ChatGPT for document work. It's convenient enough. Why should I learn yet another tool?"

Many people ask this question. Web-based AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are certainly excellent tools. However, **for administrative tasks involving multiple files simultaneously**, VS Code + Copilot is far more efficient. Just like the difference between a kitchen knife and scissors, choosing the right tool for the job is important.

Let's start with a simple comparison.

### Let's Compare with a Real Work Scenario

#### Scenario: Creating Course Registration Notices for 5 Departments

You need to create course registration notices for each college – similar but slightly different documents. Let's compare two approaches.

| Step | Web-based AI (ChatGPT/Claude) | VS Code + Copilot |
|------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **1. Preparation** | • Open new browser tab<br>• Access ChatGPT<br>• Enter prompt | • Open folder in VS Code<br>• Preview all 5 files |
| **2. Work** | • Generate first department content<br>• Copy entire text<br>• Paste into Word/HWP<br>• Save file<br>• **Repeat 5 times** | • Call Copilot in first file<br>• Auto-apply to remaining 4 files<br>• Check real-time preview |
| **3. Revision** | • Discover common changes needed<br>• Reopen 5 files<br>• Edit one by one<br>• Save again | • Select all and batch edit<br>• Copilot learns pattern and suggests<br>• Apply at once |
| **4. Completion** | • Confirm file locations<br>• Manual version control | • Auto-save complete<br>• Change history auto-recorded |
| **Time Required** | **~25 minutes** | **~10 minutes (60% savings)** |
| **Repetitive Tasks** | Copy-paste repeated 5 times | Set once, auto-apply |
| **Edit Flexibility** | Each file needs individual editing | Pattern-based batch editing |

#### Workflow Comparison

**Web-based AI Workflow:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Open ChatGPT in browser] --> B[Write and enter prompt]
    B --> C[Wait for AI response]
    C --> D[Copy entire text]
    D --> E[Open Word/HWP file]
    E --> F[Paste and adjust formatting]
    F --> G[Save file]
    G --> H{Next department?}
    H -->|Yes| B
    H -->|No| I[Changes needed]
    I --> J[Reopen 5 files]
    I --> K[Edit each file individually]
    K --> L[Save again]
    L --> M[Complete]
    
    style H fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style B fill:#ffe6cc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style K fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

**VS Code + Copilot Workflow:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Open project folder in VS Code] --> B[View 5 files simultaneously]
    B --> C[Call Copilot in first file]
    C --> D[AI automatically understands folder context]
    D --> E[Apply pattern to remaining 4 files]
    E --> F[Check with real-time preview]
    F --> G{Need edits?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Select all and batch edit]
    G -->|No| I[Auto-save]
    H --> I
    I --> J[Change history auto-recorded]
    J --> K[Complete]
    
    style D fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style E fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style H fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

### 3 Key Differences

#### 1. Folder-Based Context Understanding

**Web-based AI:**
- Understands only what you type in the chat window
- Doesn't remember patterns from previous files
- Requires repeating the same explanation every time

**VS Code + Copilot:**
- Analyzes the entire open folder
- Automatically identifies common patterns across files
- Understands even when you just say "do the rest the same way"

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Web-based AI's Vision"
        A1[Chat window<br/>content only]
    end
    
    subgraph "VS Code + Copilot's Vision"
        B1[Current file] 
        B2[Other files in<br/>same folder]
        B3[Folder structure]
        B4[Common patterns<br/>across files]
        
        B1 -.-> B2
        B2 -.-> B3
        B3 -.-> B4
    end
    
    style A1 fill:#ffe6cc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style B1 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style B2 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style B3 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style B4 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

**Real Example:**

When creating notices for 5 departments:
- **Web AI**: "Create course registration notice for College of Humanities" → copy → "Create course registration notice for College of Social Sciences" → copy (repeat)
- **VS Code**: "Create these 5 files in the same format" → done at once

#### 2. Direct Editing vs Copy-Paste

**Web-based AI:**
- AI generates → copy → paste into another program → save
- If edits needed, request AI again → copy → paste
- Formatting often breaks

**VS Code + Copilot:**
- Work by editing directly within files
- See changes in real-time
- Format and structure remain intact

**Tip**: In VS Code, you can instantly repeat "edit-check-edit-check" cycles, resulting in higher quality output.

#### 3. Automatic Consistency Maintenance

**Scenario**: After writing all 5 notices, you need to change "Registration Period" from "March 4–8, 2025" to "March 11–15, 2025"

**Web-based AI:**
```
1. Open first file → manual edit → save
2. Open second file → manual edit → save
3. Open third file → manual edit → save
4. Open fourth file → manual edit → save
5. Open fifth file → manual edit → save
Time: ~10 minutes
Error risk: Might miss one or edit incorrectly
```

**VS Code + Copilot:**
```
1. Select all files (Ctrl+Shift+F)
2. Search "March 4–8, 2025"
3. Batch replace with "March 11–15, 2025"
Time: ~30 seconds
Accuracy: All files edited identically
```

### So When Should I Use ChatGPT?

These two tools aren't competitors. **Using them together based on the situation** is most efficient.

| Task Type | Recommended Tool | Reason |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Quick Q&A | ChatGPT/Claude | • Instant answers<br>• Conversational interface is convenient<br>• No file work needed |
| Single document | ChatGPT/Claude | • One-time completion task<br>• Copy-paste is sufficient |
| Multiple files | VS Code + Copilot | • 5+ similar files<br>• Folder structure-based work<br>• When consistency is critical |
| Batch document edits | VS Code + Copilot | • Changing common content across files<br>• Pattern-based editing<br>• When version control needed |
| Idea brainstorming | ChatGPT/Claude | • Free-flowing conversation<br>• Multiple perspectives<br>• Creative suggestions |
| Template-based repetitive tasks | VS Code + Copilot | • Repeating same format<br>• Automatable tasks<br>• When mass generation needed |

#### Tool Selection Guide

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[What task are you doing?] --> B{How many files?}
    B -->|1 file| C{One-time completion?}
    B -->|2+ files| D[VS Code + Copilot recommended]
    
    C -->|Yes| E[ChatGPT/Claude recommended]
    C -->|No, frequent edits| D
    
    D --> F{Is consistency important?}
    F -->|Yes| G[VS Code + Copilot]
    F -->|No| H[Either works<br/>Choose preferred tool]
    
    E --> I{Need future edits?}
    I -->|Frequently| J[Save in VS Code and<br/>consider using Copilot]
    I -->|Rarely| K[ChatGPT/Claude]
    
    style G fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style K fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

### Practical Usage Tips

**Use them together like this:**

1. **Idea phase**: Draft in ChatGPT
2. **Execution phase**: Copy to VS Code, expand/edit with Copilot
3. **Maintenance phase**: Batch management in VS Code

**Example Workflow:**
```
ChatGPT: "Suggest structure ideas for department introduction pages"
    ↓ (Finalize idea)
VS Code: Generate 10 department pages at once based on idea
    ↓ (3 months later, edits needed)
VS Code: Batch edit common content across all pages
```

## [Level 0: Preparation] AI Anxiety Clinic - Clearing Misunderstandings Before We Start

Before we begin, let's address the three most common fears that administrative staff have.

### 1. Security Concerns
> **"Is it safe to upload university documents to AI?"**

Many people worry because of news about "personal data leaks." However, the **Enterprise version** we use is different.
*   **Free Version (Public):** Uses user data for training to get smarter. (Do NOT input sensitive data)
*   **Enterprise Version (Copilot):** **Does NOT train on your data.** Input data is encrypted, processed, and immediately discarded. (Safe to input)
*   **Conclusion:** The account provided by the university is safe. However, it's a good habit to mask sensitive personal information like resident registration numbers (***).

### 2. Accuracy Concerns
> **"Can I trust what AI writes?"**

No, you shouldn't trust it blindly. Think of AI as a **"smart intern who works well but sometimes says silly things."**
*   **AI's Role:** Drafting, suggesting ideas, simple repetitive tasks (80% of the work)
*   **Your Role:** Fact-checking, final review, taking responsibility (The remaining 20%)
*   **Conclusion:** AI is not a "truth vending machine" but a "collaboration partner." The final decision-maker is still you.

### 3. Job Security Concerns
> **"If AI does all my work, will I become obsolete?"**

Calculators didn't replace mathematicians, and Excel didn't replace accountants.
*   **What disappears:** "Boring repetitive tasks" like copy-pasting, simple summarizing, and finding typos.
*   **What remains:** "High-value work" like planning, communication, judgment, and decision-making.
*   **Conclusion:** AI won't replace you. Instead, **"Administrators who use AI well will replace those who don't."** Use this guide to become that "AI-savvy administrator."

### 1.5 The 3 Core Principles of Using Generative AI
- [ ] Learning Complete

Before learning how to use the tools, you must first establish the right **'mindset'** for working with AI. Adhering to these 3 principles alone can reduce the failure rate of AI adoption by 90%.

#### Principle 1: Delegation - "Who Does What?"
AI is not omnipotent. Think of it as a **"smart intern with no social experience."**

| Category | Tasks for AI (80%) | Tasks for Humans (20%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Drafting, summarizing, translating, data formatting | Final decision making, taking responsibility, sensitive communication |
| **Example** | "Summarize last month's meeting minutes in 3 lines" | "Deciding whether to report this agenda to the President" |
| **Example** | "Convert this table to Excel format" | "Writing a polite refusal email regarding budget cuts" |

> [!TIP]
> **Judgment Criteria:** "Can I take responsibility for this output?" If you cannot take responsibility, you must review it yourself even if you delegate it to AI.

#### Principle 2: Verification - "Trust but Verify"
The most common mistake beginners make is **"copy-pasting AI answers exactly as they are."** This is a shortcut to disaster.

**Human-in-the-Loop Workflow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Task Instruction] --> B(AI Generation);
    B --> C{Human Verification};
    C -- Pass --> D[Final Completion];
    C -- Error Found --> E[Correction Instruction];
    E --> B;
    
    style C fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#ff9800,stroke-width:2px
```

*   **Check Numbers:** Always verify budgets, dates, and phone numbers against the original source.
*   **Check URLs:** Actually click on links provided by AI. (They might be fake)
*   **Fact Check:** When AI says "According to university regulations...", look up the actual regulation book.

#### Principle 3: Consistency - "Speaking with One Voice"
When multiple people work on a large project (e.g., University Innovation Support Project Plan), or when working alone over several days, terminology and tone can become inconsistent.

*   **Problem Situation:**
    *   Page 1: "Enrolled Student" / Page 10: "Attendee" / Page 50: "Learner"
    *   Page 1: "We will do..." (Formal) / Page 20: "To do..." (Bullet points)
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Define Terms:** Before starting, instruct AI: "Unify 'student' as 'enrolled student' in this document."
    *   **Unify Tone:** Request: "Write in the same tone as the previous document."
    *   **Use VS Code:** If you put multiple files in one folder (project) and work, Copilot understands the entire context and maintains consistency.

### 2. Fundamentals: Distinguishing Chat from Autocomplete
- [ ] Learning Complete

There are two main ways to use Copilot. If you can distinguish between these two, you're in the top 10%.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[GitHub Copilot Features] --> B[Interactive Chat]
    A --> C[Autocomplete Ghost Text]
    
    B --> B1["Location: Sidebar Chat Window"]
    B --> B2["Shortcut: Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I"]
    B --> B3["Use:<br/>- Q&A/Summary<br/>- Draft Generation<br/>- Complex Requests"]
    
    C --> C1["Location: Inside Editor"]
    C --> C2["Accept: Tab Key"]
    C --> C3["Use:<br/>- Next Sentence Prediction<br/>- Auto-fill Tables<br/>- Complete Repetitive Patterns"]
    
    style B fill:#e1f5ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style C fill:#fff4e1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style B3 text-align:left
    style C3 text-align:left
```

#### 2.1 Interactive (Chat): "Do This for Me"
This is like talking to an assistant in the right chat window.
*   **When to use?** When asking questions, summarizing long texts, or asking to create something from scratch.
*   **Shortcut:** `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I` (Sidebar chat)

#### 2.2 Autocomplete (Ghost Text): "Read My Mind"
When you're writing in the editor, it shows the next content in gray text.
*   **When to use?** While writing a document, when the next sentence is obvious, when filling in tables.
*   **How to use:** Press the `Tab` key to accept if you like the gray text.

> [!TIP]
> **Administrator's Tip:** When creating a report outline, **autocomplete** is convenient, and when filling in the report content, **chat** is more convenient.

---
## Key Takeaways
- **Chat (`Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I`)**: Use for complex and creative tasks such as questions, summaries, and draft generation.
- **Autocomplete (`Tab` key)**: Use to quickly complete documents by receiving suggestions for the next content that fits the code or context.

University administrators often need to compile enrollment statistics, budget data, or performance metrics for annual reports. Let's learn how to structure data efficiently using Copilot.

**Efficiency Tip**: ChatGPT 10 min → VS Code 4 min = **60% time saved!**

> **Before You Start:** Want to see how to write effective prompts for data compilation? Check **[Appendix C.3: Annual Report Data Compilation](#example-3-annual-report-data-compilation)** for "Good vs Bad" examples.

#### [Step 1] Prepare Your Raw Data

Create a file called `enrollment_data.md` with the following sample data:

```markdown
# Enrollment Data 2022-2024

Student enrollment numbers by college for annual report compilation.

## Raw Data
2022 Engineering: 1,245 students
2022 Business: 890 students
2022 Humanities: 672 students
2022 Natural Sciences: 534 students

2023 Engineering: 1,298 students
2023 Business: 923 students
2023 Humanities: 645 students
2023 Natural Sciences: 567 students

2024 Engineering: 1,356 students
2024 Business: 981 students
2024 Humanities: 638 students
2024 Natural Sciences: 589 students

Total Budget: 2022=$45M, 2023=$48M, 2024=$52M
```

#### [Step 2] Write a Detailed Prompt

Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I`) and enter the following structured prompt:

> **Input:**
> 
> "I am a planning department staff member preparing the annual report. Using the enrollment data above, please create a summary table with the following specifications:
> 
> **Role:** Planning department administrator compiling statistics
> **Context:** Need year-over-year enrollment comparison for executive presentation
> **Output Requirements:**
> 1. Create a markdown table with columns: College Name | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 3-Year Change (%)
> 2. Calculate percentage change from 2022 to 2024 for each college
> 3. Add a 'Total' row at the bottom with sum of all colleges
> 4. Below the table, write 2-3 sentences analyzing the enrollment trend
> 5. Format should be Excel-compatible (copy-paste ready)"

#### [Step 3] Request Table + Trend Analysis

Copilot will generate a properly formatted table like this:

| College Name | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 3-Year Change (%) |
|:-------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|------------------:|
| Engineering | 1,245 | 1,298 | 1,356 | +8.9% |
| Business | 890 | 923 | 981 | +10.2% |
| Humanities | 672 | 645 | 638 | -5.1% |
| Natural Sciences | 534 | 567 | 589 | +10.3% |
| **Total** | **3,341** | **3,433** | **3,564** | **+6.7%** |

**Trend Analysis:** Overall enrollment increased 6.7% over three years, with strongest growth in Natural Sciences (+10.3%) and Business (+10.2%). Humanities showed a decline of 5.1%, requiring strategic review.

#### [Step 4] Review and Verify Calculations

Always double-check:
- Percentages calculated correctly
- Totals match sum of columns
- Year labels aligned with data
- Trend analysis mentions key insights

> **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
> 
> - **Vague Request:** "Organize this data for the report" → No specifications on format or analysis
> - **Missing Structure:** Not specifying table columns → Inconsistent output format
> - **No Context:** Not mentioning "executive presentation" → Overly detailed analysis
> - **Forgetting Verification:** Accepting output without checking calculations → Data accuracy errors
> 
> **Pro Tip:** Always request "Excel-compatible format" if you need to paste into spreadsheets. See [Appendix C.3](#example-3-annual-report-data-compilation) for more examples.

#### [Step 5] Export to Excel Format

1. Copy the generated markdown table
2. Open Excel or Google Sheets
3. Paste directly (Ctrl/Cmd + V)
4. The table structure will automatically convert to cells

> [!NOTE]
> **Success Check:** Did Copilot generate an accurate table with trend analysis in under 2 minutes? If so, you've mastered data compilation!

---
## Key Takeaways
- Structured prompts with Role, Context, and Output specifications produce well-formatted data tables

### Self-Assessment Quiz
<details>
<summary>Q1. When you want to create a visualization report based on meeting minutes files on your computer, which agent is most effective to call?</summary>
**A1.** The `@workspace` agent.
</details>

**Why VS Code?**
With the `@workspace` agent, you can reference multiple files and generate tables and charts (Mermaid diagrams) all within a single environment. In ChatGPT, you'd need to manually upload files, copy-paste chart code to separate viewers, and reassemble everything—but VS Code handles file references, content extraction, and visualization rendering automatically in one integrated workflow. (For more details, see [here](#why-vs-code--copilot-instead-of-chatgpt))

## C. Good vs Bad Prompt Examples

Understanding what makes a good prompt is essential. Below are three real administrative scenarios showing the difference between vague and effective prompts.

### The R.C.O. Formula for Good Prompts
- **R**ole: Who is the AI helping? (e.g., "You are assisting a university admin staff member...")
- **C**ontext: What's the situation? (e.g., "Our department is hosting a year-end event...")
- **O**utput: What format do you need? (e.g., "Write a 200-word email in polite tone...")

---

### Example 1: Department-Wide Email Drafting

#### Bad Prompt (Vague)
```
Write an email about the event.
```

**Problems:**
- No context: What event? Who is the audience?
- No tone guidance: Formal or casual?
- No format requirements: Length? Key points to include?

#### Good Prompt (Using R.C.O.)
```
You are helping a university General Affairs staff member draft an official email.

**Context:** Our department is hosting a year-end faculty appreciation dinner on December 22nd, 6 PM at the University Conference Hall. We need to invite all faculty members (approximately 120 people).

**Output Requirements:**
- Write a 200-word email in polite business tone
- Include: Event purpose, date/time/location, RSVP deadline (December 15th), dress code (business casual)
- End with contact information (General Affairs Office, ext. 1234)
```

**Why it's better:** Provides complete context, specifies exact length and tone, lists all required details.

---

### Example 2: Meeting Minutes Summarization

#### Bad Prompt (Vague)
```
Summarize this meeting.
```

**Problems:**
- No focus: Summarize what aspects? Action items? Decisions?
- No format: Bullet points? Paragraph? Table?
- No audience consideration: For participants or executives?

#### Good Prompt (Using R.C.O.)
```
You are helping a university Planning Office staff member summarize a budget meeting.

**Context:** This is a 2-hour budget allocation meeting with 5 department heads. The transcript is attached below. The summary will be shared with the Vice President who needs to make final decisions.

**Output Requirements:**
- Create a structured summary with these sections:
  1. Key Decisions Made (bullet points)
  2. Budget Allocation by Department (table format)
  3. Unresolved Issues (numbered list)
  4. Action Items with Deadlines (who/what/when format)
- Keep the total summary under 500 words
- Use professional tone suitable for executive review

[Paste meeting transcript here]
```

**Why it's better:** Defines the audience (Vice President), specifies exact structure, provides word limit, and explains the summary's purpose.

---

### Example 3: Annual Report Data Compilation

#### Bad Prompt (Vague)
```
Organize this data for the report.
```

**Problems:**
- No data context: What type of data? What report?
- No visualization needs: Tables? Charts? Text?
- No comparison requirements: Year-over-year? Trends?

#### Good Prompt (Using R.C.O.)
```
You are helping a university Student Affairs staff member compile annual enrollment statistics for the 2024 Academic Report.

**Context:** I have raw enrollment data for 2022, 2023, and 2024 across 8 colleges. The data includes new students, transfers, leave of absence, and graduations. This will be presented to the Board of Trustees.

**Output Requirements:**
- Create a summary table showing:
  - Total enrollment by year (2022-2024)
  - Percentage change year-over-year
  - Top 3 colleges by enrollment growth
- Highlight any significant trends (e.g., >10% change)
- Write 3-4 sentence interpretation of the data trends
- Format: Excel-compatible table with clear headers

**Data:**
[Paste raw data here: College name, year, enrollment numbers, etc.]
```

**Why it's better:** Specifies data type and timeframe, defines exact table structure, requests trend analysis, and indicates the output format needed.

### Impact Comparison

| Prompt Type | Time to Get Useful Result | Revision Cycles Needed | Output Quality |
|:------------|:--------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------|
| Bad (Vague) | 15-20 minutes | 3-4 revisions | 40-60% usable |
| Good (R.C.O.) | 3-5 minutes | 0-1 revisions | 85-95% usable |

        G2 --> G3[Minor Tweaks Only]
        G3 --> G4[Ready to Use]
        G4 --> G5[5 Minutes]
    end
    
    style Bad fill:#ffebee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style Good fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000

    style G5 fill:#a5d6a7,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

**Key Takeaway:** Spending 2 extra minutes writing a detailed prompt saves 15+ minutes in revisions and manual corrections.
